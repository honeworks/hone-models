description: Run or write real-model tests (tests/gpu, marker gpu) safely on a shared GPU - the machine-wide lock, model names from environment variables, skips with reasons, unloading models. Use before running or changing anything under tests/gpu or code that drives a real model.

# Real-model tests

Details: CONTRIBUTING.md, "Real-model tests and `scripts/gpu-lock.sh`".

**Run**
- Only through the lock: `scripts/gpu-lock.sh uv run pytest -m gpu -q`. It waits for the machine-wide
  lock (`$HONE_GPU_LOCK`), so runs from several projects never share a small GPU.
- Models come from the environment: `HONE_TEST_OLLAMA_URL`, `HONE_TEST_TEXT_MODEL`, `HONE_TEST_THINKING_MODEL`, `HONE_TEST_VISION_MODEL`, `HONE_TEST_EMBED_MODEL`. Set them for your machine in
  `.claude/settings.local.json` under `env` (not committed).
- Never start or stop the Ollama service and never delete models.

**Write**
- Put the test in `tests/gpu/` with `@pytest.mark.gpu` (plus `ollama` or `comfyui`).
- Check the service and model are available first; if not, `pytest.skip` with a precise reason.
- Few calls, small outputs; assert types, ranges and clear-cut order, never exact model text.
- Unload what you loaded (Ollama: `keep_alive: 0`).

**Report** what ran and what was skipped, with reasons, in the PR's "How it was tested".
